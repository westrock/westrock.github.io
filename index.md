I've been a software developer since the 1980's and have worked with IBM 360/370 machines using assembler (also called BAL), languages such as FORTRAN, PL/1, COBOL (only as a tool for testing even more assembly code), platforms like Macintosh (pre-OS X) using Pascal, C and C++, and the Microsoft web tools Active Server Pages and .Net.

### Resume
My [resume](/resume) is located here.  I am currently a full time employee and have interests in solving and building large system problems. I am not great at maintenance since I have always prided myself in coding highly maintainable solutions and getting things right before they ship/deploy.  I can go in and hunt down defects but I believe my talents are better served creating solutions rather than fixing mistakes.  I have worked with many who love to fix bugs and that is a tremendous skill that I hold in high regard.
