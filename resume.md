# Edward Figarsky

I am experienced in all phases of commercial and in-house software development, including requirements gathering, analysis and design, authoring specifications and documentation, programming, database design, team-leadership, and pre- and post-deployment.  I am able to understand and apply business needs in order to architect solutions that balance the conflicting criteria of cost, time, and functionality in order to provide maintainable and efficient solutions.  My experience as a small business owner, being responsible for all aspects of operation from back office to the sales floor has provided me with a rich understanding of business that is not commonly found in software processionals.
